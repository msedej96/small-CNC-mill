# small-CNC-mill
A small CNC milling machine that is primarily intended for milling prototype PCBs, small wooden and plastic parts.

I designed and assembled the construction from custom made aluminum plates and Bosch Rexroth aluminum profiles.
The aluminum panels were cut using a water jet material cutting process. At the end, the panels were milled with a milling machine.
